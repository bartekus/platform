The sslmode parameter in PostgreSQL client connections controls the level of SSL/TLS security enforced for the connection. It dictates how the client behaves when attempting to establish an SSL-encrypted connection with the PostgreSQL server.

Here are the common sslmode options and their implications:
 - disable: No SSL connection is attempted. The connection will be unencrypted.
 - allow: The client first attempts a non-SSL connection. If that fails, it then attempts an SSL connection.
 - prefer (default for libpq-based clients like psql): The client first attempts an SSL connection. If that fails, it then attempts a non-SSL connection. This is the default but is not recommended for secure deployments as it prioritizes convenience over security.
 - require: The client only attempts an SSL connection. If the server does not accept an SSL connection, the connection fails. This mode provides protection against passive attacks but is vulnerable to active attacks if server identity is not verified.
 - verify-ca: The client requires an SSL connection and verifies the server's certificate against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) root certificate. This ensures the server is trusted but does not verify the server's identity (hostname).
 - verify-full (default for JDBC clients): The client requires an SSL connection and performs full server certificate verification, including checking the server's hostname against the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SANs). This provides the highest level of security.

To use verify-ca or verify-full, you typically need to provide the path to the CA root certificate using the sslrootcert parameter. You might also need to provide client certificate and key files using sslcert and sslkey for client authentication.
